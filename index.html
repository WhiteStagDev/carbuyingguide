        <h3>Do you need All-wheel drive (AWD), Two wheel drive (2WD), or Four wheel drive (4WD)?</h3>
        <p>The biggest difference is that a 2WD transmission will send power to two wheels, while 4WD uses all four wheels. 2WD vehicles are excellent at driving on dry, flat roads and they can be more affordable than 4WD and AWD vehicles, which often carry a premium price tag and tend to be slightly less fuel efficient.</p><br>
        <p>However, AWD vehicles are great for rain, light snow, or icy roads, as it automatically distributes power to the wheels that need it the most, improving stability and control.</p><br>
        <p>4WD vehicles are great for off-roading and tough, challenging driving conditions such as snow, mud, sand, and steep inclines. They are also used for carrying heavy loads and towing.</p>

      <h3>Do I want a 4 cylinder engine or a 6 cylinder engine?</h3>

        <h3>1. 4-Cylinder Engine</h3>
        <p>Generally, 4-cylinder engines are smaller and produce less horsepower compared to 6-cylinder engines. They are typically found in compact cars, sedans, and economy vehicles. These engines are more efficient but may struggle to deliver the same level of acceleration and performance as a 6-cylinder engine.</p><br>
        <p>A 4-cylinder engine offers better fuel efficiency because it burns less fuel. These engines can sometimes be rougher, especially when they are under heavy load or when accelerating quickly. Smaller engines tend to vibrate more, which can result in a less smooth driving experience.</p><br>
        <p>Vehicles with 4-cylinder engines are usually more affordable, both in terms of purchase price and maintenance costs. These engines are less complex, so repairs and parts tend to be cheaper.</p><br>
        <p>Due to their lower power output, 4-cylinder engines are typically less suited for towing heavy loads. While they can handle light towing tasks, they may struggle with larger trailers or heavier cargo.</p><br>
        <p>In terms of driving experience, 4-cylinder engines tend to be more efficient for everyday driving, offering sufficient power for most city and highway needs. However, some drivers may find them less exciting.</p><br>

        <h3>2. 6-Cylinder Engine</h3>
        <p>With two more cylinders, 6-cylinder engines produce more power and torque. This means better acceleration, higher towing capacity, and improved performance at higher speeds. You'll typically find 6-cylinder engines in mid-sized to larger vehicles, such as trucks, SUVs, and higher-performance sedans.</p><br>
        <p>A 6-cylinder engine generally uses more fuel because it has more cylinders. A 6-cylinder engine offers smoother performance, as the power is distributed more evenly across more cylinders. This reduces vibration and provides a more refined driving experience, especially at higher speeds or under load.</p><br>
        <p>Vehicles with 6-cylinder engines are often more expensive, both in terms of the price and maintenance. Repairs or replacements may cost more.</p><br>
        <p>A 6-cylinder engine, especially a V6, generally provides better towing capacity. It‚Äôs a better choice for people who need to tow boats, trailers, or carry heavy loads.</p><br>

        <h3>In Summary:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4-Cylinder Engines:</strong> Offer better fuel efficiency, lower cost, and are often used in compact cars. They are ideal for those looking for affordability and efficiency, but might lack the power for heavy towing or fast driving.</li>
            <li><strong>6-Cylinder Engines:</strong> Provide more power, better acceleration, and smoother performance, especially for larger vehicles or those used for towing. They use more fuel, cost more to maintain, and can be heavier. But they go faster and offer a smoother ride.</li>

      <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Step 7: What safety features are important to you?</h3>
        <p>Do you want blind-spot warning, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking, or backup camera, for examples? What types of safety features are important to you? It helps some drivers when a warning light or sound happens if you veer over to another lane or if you are about to hit something.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step8">
    <h3>üìâ Step 8: How many miles do you want on your car?</h3>
        <p>You will have a harder time getting a bank loan if you buy a car over 80k to 100k miles or a car that is over 6 or 7 years old. Banks don't like financing cars that are this old. This is the time when the car will start needing repairs.</p><br>
        <p>You may be able to get a bank loan however, there will be a big jump in the interest rate. The sweet spot for buying cars is between 2 and 4 years or 50k to 80k miles. If you plan on getting something over 100k miles, plan on fixing things yourself. Also, buying a car with less miles will avoid expensive repair costs (and even if you fix it yourself, the parts are still expensive).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step9">
      <h3>üé® Step 9: What color do I want?</h3>
        <p>You may choose a color but this doesn't always mean that you will get what you want. I have wanted a certain color of car but ended up with another color because the car was in great condition and met all of my criteria including mileage, safety, and price.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step10">
      <h3>üíµ Step 10. How Much Car <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment</span> Can I Afford?</h3>
      <p>13% of your take-home pay (after taxes) for just the car payment seems to fall within a reasonable range. However, keep in mind that the total cost of owning and operating the vehicle will be higher when you add things like insurance and maintenance. Make sure that your remaining income can cover other essential living expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, food, medical, savings, and other spending.</p><br>
      <p>The size of the car payment will depend on the car price, loan term (months to pay it off), interest rate, and down payment. If you opt for a longer loan term (ex. 72 or 84 months), your monthly payment might be more affordable, but the total cost of the car over time, will be higher.</p><br>
      <p>The most common loan term for car purchases in the U.S. typically ranges from 60 months (5 years) to 72 months (6 years). However, the most popular term tends to be 72 months. According to data from various automotive industry sources, about 40% of car buyers opt for a 72-month loan, especially as car prices have risen, and monthly payments need to be spread over a longer period to make them more affordable.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step11">
      <h3>üìà Step 11. What Does "Interest Rate" Mean?</h3>
      <p>Interest rate is the cost that you pay to the lender (bank) for borrowing money to buy your car (car loan). Interest is the extra money you pay when you borrow money. It's like an extra charge for using someone‚Äôs money. If you borrow $10 from a friend, they might ask for $1 back or 10% as a thank-you for letting you use their money. That extra $1 is interest. The bigger the loan, the more interest you might have to pay.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step12">
      <h3>üìä Step 12. What is a Credit Score?</h3>
      <p>It all depends on your credit score. A credit score is a number that shows how good you are at paying back money you owe. It's like a report card for your borrowing habits. The higher your score, the better you are at managing debt. Lenders, like banks, use your credit score to decide if they should give you a loan and how much interest they might charge you.</p><br>
      <p>Credit scores usually range from 300 to 850. A higher score means you're seen as a low‚Äërisk borrower, while a lower score might mean you're a higher risk.

      <h3>Example: Average Used Car Loan Interest Rates as of December¬†2024</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>750 or higher: 10.62%</li>
        <li>700‚Äë749: 11.27%</li>
        <li>600‚Äë699: 15.67%</li>
        <li>451‚Äë599: 17.04%</li>
        <li>450 or lower: No loan</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Lenders will also want to know what debts you have and they will assess your credit, income, and debt levels to determine how much they‚Äôre willing to lend to you.</p>
          </section>

    <section class="section" id="step13">
      <h3>üí≥ Step 13. What is APR (Annual Percentage Rate)?</h3>
    <p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the yearly interest rate you will pay on the balance of your loan. It is written as a percentage. This helps you understand how much you'll really pay for borrowing money over a year.</p><br>

    <h3>Credit Scores and Approximate Loan APRs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Excellent (750‚Äë850): 2.96% for new, 3.68% for used car</li>
      <li>Good (700‚Äë749): 4.03% for new, 5.53% for used car</li>
      <li>Fair (650‚Äë699): 6.75% for new, 10.33% for used car</li>
      <li>Poor (450‚Äë649): 12.84% for new, 20.43% for used car</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>These APRs can change depending on the type of loan that you get and also depends on what kind of deal the car dealership wants to make with you and the bank.</p>

    <section class="section" id="step14">
      <h3>üîÅ Step 14. Trading In Your Old Car</h3>
    <h3>How Do I Trade in My Old Car?</h3>
    <p>Make sure it is paid off first. It is a big hassle to try to trade in your car if it isn't paid off yet. If you still owe on it, you may want to sell it, get the cash and use that cash as a down payment for your new car. You will still need to pay off that car loan.</p><br>

    <h3>Should I Repair My Car?</h3>
    <p>People sometimes try to fix dents on their cars or put on a new set of tires, thinking it will add to the value of their trade‚Äëin. This doesn't work. The dealer can usually fix flaws and put on new tires for less than you can.</p><br>

    <h3>Can You Trade in a Car That Has Issues?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but how big those issues are will affect its value. If your vehicle has a few light scratches and a minor dent, it shouldn't impact its value too much. On the other hand, if it has serious engine issues or has been in an accident, expect to be offered much less. I bought a car once and it had been in a minor fender bender. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal until I sold it. I got less money because it had been in one accident.</p><br>

      <h3>üè™ Step 17. Should I Buy from This Dealership? <strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong></h3>
      <h3>Searching for a Car Dealership</h3>
      <p>Do a search for the dealership that offers the car. Make sure it is the same city where the car is being offered because companies have different branches in different cities. Sometimes, a dealership will say that they can ship the car from another location. Be careful because when you finally go to see the car, they may not have it and try to sell you something else.</p><br>
      <p>Please, read the Google reviews about the car dealerships. The dealership may have great reviews and you can comfortably shop there. However, if there are many bad reviews, then you should probably shop somewhere else, even if the car that you want is there. <strong>Buyer Beware!</strong></p>

      <h3>üÜî Step 18. Vehicle History Report</h3>
      <p>Checking a car's history provides important information about the car's past: accident history, maintainence details, and past ownership.</p><br>
      <p>You must check the VIN number of the car that you want to buy. A VIN Number, or Vehicle Identification Number is a unique code used to identify individual motor vehicles. It typically consists of 17 numbers that provide information on the vehicle's make, model, year, and place of manfacture. Use these websites for free:</p>

        <h3>Check Safety Reviews for the Car</h3>
        <p>What kind of safety reviews does this car have?</p>
        <h3>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - USA</h3>
        <p>The NHTSA provides comprehensive safety ratings for vehicles sold in the United States. Their ratings are based on crash tests and other safety factors. To check the rating:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visit the NHTSA Vehicle Crash Test Ratings website: <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings" target="_blank">nhtsa.gov/ratings</a>.</li>
          <li>Enter the make, model, and year of the car you're interested in.</li>
          <li>Review the safety ratings, which include overall ratings as well as separate scores for frontal crash, side crash, and rollover resistance.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <h3>Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) - USA</h3>
        <p>The IIHS provides safety ratings based on crash tests and how well cars perform in various accident scenarios.</p><br>
        <p>Visit the IIHS website: <a href="https://www.iihs.org" target="_blank">iihs.org</a>.</p><br>
        <p>Use the search bar to enter the make, model, and year of the vehicle. Check out the vehicle‚Äôs safety ratings and read detailed information about crash test results.</p>

      <h3>üöò Final Steps: Visiting the Dealership</h3>
      <p>If everything checks out, then go look at the car. Make sure that you test drive the car. Expect to spend a few hours at the dealership. It takes a long time to secure a loan and do all of the paperwork.</p><br>
      <p>Bring your driver's license, a credit card or checkbook, the copy of your car title for a trade-in, and the name and phone number of your car insurance company, so that you can transfer the insurance to the new car. Lenders may also ask for documents like pay stubs, tax returns, or proof of identity.</p><br>
      <p>Next, they will take you into a back office with a <strong>Finance Manager</strong>. They are responsible for presenting and selling additional products such as extended warranties, service contracts, gap insurance, protection plans, and financing options to customers.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Be very careful with this part of the transaction.</strong> You don't want to buy extra things that will only cost you more money and not pay off in the end. Google the companies that they try to sell products for.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="step22">
      <h3>Should I Get Pre-Approved Before I Go to the Dealership?</h3>
      <p>A pre-approval for a car loan is an agreement from a lender (like a bank, credit union, or online lender) that indicates they are willing to lend you a certain amount of money to buy a car, based on a preliminary review of your financial situation.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Key points about pre-approval:</strong> They will perform a credit check, and give you information about the potential loan amount, interest rate, and loan term (how long you‚Äôll take to repay the loan). A pre-approval is typically valid for a limited time (e.g., 30-45 days), so you‚Äôll need to finalize the purchase within that period.</p>

      <h3>But wait!</h3>
      <h3>Shop Around</h3>
      <p>Even with a pre-approval, it's smart to shop around for the best deal. Pre-approvals give you a solid baseline, but dealerships may have promotions, special financing, or rebates that could influence your decision.</p><br>
      <p>In short, while dealerships might try to pressure you or make their financing seem like the only option, your pre-approval allows you to shop freely and compare offers, so you‚Äôre never locked into just one place. Always be sure to read the fine print and consider all your options. Be careful that a car dealership doesn‚Äôt lock you into an agreement with the pre-approval.</p><br>
      <h3>‚ùó Bonus Tip:</h3>
      <p>Walk into a dealership and let them know exactly what you want. It is helpful to have the Stock Number of the car. If they try to sell you something else, walk out.</p><br>
      <p>Also, be sure that the car that you want matches the pictures. I have been lied to and have found major problems with the cars that I was looking forward to buying. I walked out. One time, the dealership told me that they had the car and would bring it. I waited 45 minutes and couldn‚Äôt find anyone to help me. So, I drove around to the garage and saw that they were repairing the same car. I left.</p><br>
      <p>Stick with your price range, the mileage, and type of car that you want. Take your time, do your research, and test drive the car. You will make an excellent choice.</p>
